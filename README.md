### 1. Linear Regression ML Project: Social Media Impact on Mental Health
**File**: `10_MLproject_By_Using_LinearRegression.ipynb`

This project analyzes the relationship between social media usage (hours per day) and mental health scores using linear regression.

#### Project Overview
- **Objective**: Predict mental health scores based on hours spent on social media using linear regression
- **Dataset**: Hours on Social Media vs Mental Health Score (Daily tracking data)
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn

#### Key Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Linear regression model training and evaluation
- Correlation analysis between social media usage and mental health
- Visualizations showing the impact of social media on mental health
- Model performance metrics and predictions

#### Quick Start
1. Open the notebook: [10_MLproject_By_Using_LinearRegression.ipynb](./10_MLproject_By_Using_LinearRegression.ipynb)
2. Click "Open in Colab" to run in Google Colab
